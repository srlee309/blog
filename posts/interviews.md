# Interviews

## The interview process is flawed

The interviewing process for hiring developers as it is practiced today is deeply flawed¹. From the candidate’s point of view, it is a daunting, time-consuming process and from the employers point of view it is an expensive process that often has middling results.

There are a few major reasons for this:

- Difficulty - interviewing is a hard problem where you are trying to predict future performance based only on a few hours worth of data². It is also a complex problem because performance is driven by a multitude of factors, for example, intelligence, experience, personality and suitability to a particular team.
- Interviews are stressful for candidates - interviews are often extremely stressful for candidates which means that there performance in the interview is often variable and not necessarily reflective of their actual abilities. Some people are better than others at presenting, expressing and promoting themselves and this often has a large impact on the hiring decision even though in the majority of cases these skills don't predict better job performance.
- Lack of training - interviewers are often expected to run interviews without any formal training or sometimes preparation. Most developers would quickly point out that they don’t have enough experience if they were asked to develop something that they don’t know enough about, but when it comes to interviewing most people assume that they will be good enough at it. This is strange because it is actually very hard to conduct a good interview. Getting a good read on a candidate's abilities and weaknesses and to be able to do so repeatedly and reliably is a very hard thing to do.
- Low quality feedback is the norm - the feedback loop for interviewers is too long and incomplete to allow people to see their mistakes and improve themselves. Consequently, most people in the industry are following many bad practices. A major reason that companies and employers neglect preparing and training people for interviews is that the parameters for a great interview are hard to discern and the indicators of a poorly run interview have low visibility. The repercussions from a poorly run interview are generally long term and hard to see. While it is true that a sub optimal hiring decision can result in a catastrophe where the hired candidate ends up getting fired, most of the time it just means hiring someone ok instead of someone great.

## Low quality interviews are expensive

On a large scale, low quality interviews can have massive financial implications for a company. The costs associated with a bad or mediocre hire are substantial even if they not always visible. For example, there are costs associated with:

- Decreases in employee morale and company culture as poor hiring choices lead to dysfunctions in teams and greater levels of staff turnover.
- Decreases in team productivity as new hires require more time and resources from existing team members to upskill and become productive.
- Missed potential in terms of the productivity gains and innovations a great employee can bring
- A higher chance of the employee leaving earlier which means that the costs associated with recruiting and training a new hire including the costs of interviews (and all the steps associated with the interview process) need to be paid again. Employees that leave earlier also never become fully productive as it can take a new employee 1-2 years to reach the productivity level of an existing long term employee.

## Ranking different interview approaches

The goal of an Interview is to evaluate a candidates potential to perform well in a given role. This means that a poorly run interview is one in which this goal is unable to be reached or the resultant evaluation is incorrect. The interview process, due its nature, is likely to always be flawed, but we can rank different approaches in accordance with the below criteria:

- Rigor - how thorough is the evaluation of the candidate
- Value - how focused is the evaluation on the factors that matter.
- Time cost - how long does it take for the candidate and employer.
- Pressure - how stressful is the experience for the candidate.
- Reliability - how trustworthy, accurate and repeatable are the results of an interview

Some example types of evaluations are:

- Traditional coding interviews which are rigorous, reliable and valuable, but high pressure and extremely costly in terms of time. Most coding interviews are not targeted or focused on the areas that matter which means they are often not as valuable or reliable as they could be.
- Take home exercises which are rigorous, but have high time cost (and are also, potentially less rigorous, valuable and reliable, as it is hard to know whether the candidate did the coding themselves).
- Behavioral interviews which aren’t particularly high pressure or time consuming, but are awful for assessing whether a candidate can actually code.

## Characteristics of high quality interviews

### Focused evaluations

A lot of job descriptions are written without performing a deep reflection of what is actually required or analyzing the most accurate predictors of job performance³. This can lead to three problems:

1. Excluding potential candidates by asking for things much in excess of what is actually required.
2. Wasting the candidates and the interviewers time on candidates who don't have the skills and experience required for the role.
3. Interviewers being unsure of how to evaluate candidates. This leads to great variability in how different interviewers evaluate candidates as each interviewer essentially makes up their own criteria. It also often leads to low quality evaluations as it takes time and effort to create high quality criteria.

Interviewing a candidate is about the targeted evaluation of their abilities. The targeted aspect of this is very important and it is where most companies make mistakes. Due to a lack of preparation and consideration of what is actually required for the role, employers often look to google to find a standard set of questions to ask or use leetcode⁴ type of questions or even worse syntax trivia questions. This leads them to evaluate candidates based on things that don’t accurately predict future performance in the role they are interviewing for. As a consequence, the evaluations seem more rigorous as they have an increased time cost and pressure, but the actual value and impact on the ability to choose high quality candidates isn’t improved too much.

#### What to do:

As much as possible, the interview should cover areas that accurately predict whether a candidate will be a successful⁵ software engineer at your organization. This means that writing code that is relevant to the role should make up a large portion of the interview. Take home projects or live coding, both can work and both have their advantages and disadvantages. Whichever one is used, it should be related to the role and limited to an appropriate amount of time, e.g. a few hours at the most. Avoid interview questions that over-index on topics that don’t matter. For example, sorting algorithm questions which mostly just tell you how recently someone was in school or how thoroughly someone has prepped for interview questions, not whether they’ll write good software.

### Structured questions

Most hiring decisions are replete with bias and are determined largely by decisions from the gut⁶. This means that they are highly variable and often suboptimal. It is also the reason why one of the most consistent findings⁷ in the research is that structured⁸ interviews are much more reliable and valid than unstructured interviews.

#### What to do:

Ask questions that are:

- Role related - assuming that you are already competent in a role, a good way to craft these questions is to think of things a colleague or someone you met would need to say for you to respect them.
- Applicable to all candidates - each candidate is asked the same questions based on what is required for the role. This provides candidates with the equal opportunity to showcase their abilities. If there are several managers involved in the interview process, then each manager is using the same criteria and through sharing detailed notes can reach agreement in who to select. In unstructured interviews, the questions are not consistent across candidates and can change depending on how the conversation flows with different people, making it harder to draw comparisons.
- About specific situations - it is more effective to ask for specific situations than a general identity questions like what are your weaknesses. Asking for real examples is often less intimidating than a completely open ended question. Plus, it becomes a more interesting conversation as it leads to follow-up questions that help you better understand the candidate. For example, why did you decide to do X? How did you know it was successful? What did you do the next time this happened? How did you convince Y? What happened the next time they reviewed your code? etc.

### Optimise the candidate experience

In an interview, everything should be lined up to help the candidate succeed. The candidate should not need to deal with vague instructions, unclear expectations or the mind-games of trying to guess "what does the interviewer actually want". They shouldn't have to deal with antagonistic or hostile personalities.

You want the candidate to be able to do their best. If you turn down a candidate, you want to be 100% sure you turned them down because, despite all efforts, they weren't able to perform in the areas that mattered. You don't want to end up hesitating, unsure whether a candidate did badly only because the interviewer was a jerk or the task given was vague and unclear. Lastly, you want every candidate to have a good experience. Even if you don't want to hire them, they probably have friends you would want to hire! Word spreads, and remember that during an interview, the candidate is interviewing your company as well.

To help candidates best express themselves and highlight their best and most relevant qualities the interviewer can:

- Provide information on the interview format before the interview. Technical interviews can be intimidating to all different types of people as they are naturally high-stress situations. Giving information on the interview before hand can be one way to allow people to prepare themselves.
- Use active listening. Preparation and allocating dedicated time to the interview is of utmost importance to its success. An interviewer who has not done these things will be distracted and unable to completely focus on the candidate and their answers.
- Use probing. Some people are naturally more reticent than others. Probing, or the use of well crafted follow up questions, can help these people to better express themselves fully. It is also important to allow candidate to have the time to reflect and form their responses before speaking.
- Control the conversation. Nervousness and misunderstandings in an environment where you are trying your best to appear competent often lead to interviews getting off track. A good interviewer will be able to bring the conversation back to the points that matter.

#### What to do:

- Continually review and simplify the interview to make it challenging only in the areas that matter
- Interviews, like conversations, are two way. The candidate is also evaluating what it will be like working for your company and in the role they are interviewing for. It is important, therefore, for interviewers to consider the candidate experience and to promote the company and the role.
- Provide useful feedback to the candidate. Help make them to become better able to get the position if they were to interview again.

### Train interviewers

A general attitude at most companies is that hiring isn’t a big deal. It's seen a chore rather than a critical part of organizational development. Hiring is often a task relegated to whoever is available at the time. People think they can naturally interview others well and they can just figure it out. In reality, it's a process that involves a lot of trial-and-error. Hiring managers don't know what to look for in a good candidate; most aren't properly trained on qualities to look for and they don't properly value certain traits, instead often relying on degrees or other similar accomplishments as large factors in the hiring decision

### Get structured feedback

Unit testing and testing in general is an integral part of developing code. On a broader level, feedback is essential to achieving agility. When it comes to interviews, however, the feedback received is often low quality and fragmented. If the interview process is a large part of what determines the long term success of a company, then the process of gaining feedback on interviews is also vital.

The best way to gain high quality feedback is to create a situation that has known/good conditions. This better enables you to determine the causal factors involved with any outcomes received. In terms of interviewing, this would mean interviewing people you know and work with already. Run them through the process and treat them exactly as you would a candidate. Another alternative is asking all candidates a set of questions on how the interview went.

## Employee training and retention programs are often less costly than hiring new candidates

A company that can retain their employees has a great competitive advantage over those that don’t. This is because it takes time until people become fully productive in a role and in companies with high turnover people tend towards a destructively short term perspective. They know that they aren’t going to be in the company for very long, so they don’t focus on quality or things with long term payoffs. Delivery is all that matters no matter the cost in terms of maintenance, rework and support.

A common feature of companies with the lowest turnover is widespread retraining. You’re forever bumping into managers and officers who started out as secretaries, payroll clerks or in the mailroom. They came into the company green, often right out of school. When they needed new skills to make a change, the company provided those skills. No job is a dead end. Retraining is not the cheapest way to fill a new slot. It’s always cheaper in the short run to fire the person who needs retraining and hire someone else who already has the required skills. Most organizations do just that. The best organizations do not. They realize that retraining helps to build the mentality of permanence that results in low turnover and a strong sense of community. They realize that this more often tan not justifies its cost.

Here is a quick summary of a few types of bad interviews.

- The Riddler - this is the person who asks puzzle questions to “see how you think”, e.g. what are manhole covers round. These types of questions are too abstract and removed from the role. That is, the answers don’t correlate to the ability to the job. They are also frustrating to the candidate.
- The Disorienter - similar to the Riddler, this is someone who asks programming questions that have nothing to do with the job at hand. This could be writing Sudoku puzzles when this has no correlation to the job. These types of questions are also frustrating to the candidate as they don’t allow them to demonstrate the skills that they are proficient at.
- The Stone Tablet - this is the person who has a candidate write code on a white board. Whiteboard coding is unnatural and gives fewer insights into true coding ability. They are an inadequate means for the candidate to demonstrate their capabilities.
- The Knuth Fanatic – this is the person who uses tough algorithms and data structure questions. This is an issue because most modern software development requires skills outside of algorithms and data structures. The candidate feels like breadth of skills is not being properly tested and that they would have done just as well, perhaps even better, when they were a recent college graduate. Overall interviews should be evaluating people on their years of experience if studying for a week or month significantly improves a candidates chances of getting hired then it indicates that the evaluations are incorrect.
- The Cram Session - this is the person who “studies” for an interview, either by asking friends or by looking up common interview questions. This is the type of person who is looking for the right answer, but often does have the competency to actually do a property evaluation. They are looking for sound bites or key phrases.
- Groundhog Day – this is the person who doesn’t update their interview questions when they become out of date with the current best practices. Candidate is left feeling like the company is using old technologies or processes and it often excludes candidates who can’t answer these older questions.
- The Gladiator – this is the person who is combative and challenging. An adversarial interview is a problem because it induces stress in the candidate and stress interferes with their ability to present and express themselves. It also gives the candidate a poor impression of the company.
- Hear No Evil – this person never seeks feedback from candidates on interviewing skills.

Determining ability is difficult and previous outcomes are rarely tracked using objective metrics like track records, contests or prediction markets. This means that interviewers must often rely on shortcuts to determine ability, For example, often what makes a large impression on the hiring decision are things like personal impressions, personal recommendations, flattering stories of previous outcomes and the prestige of schools or corporations someone has been involved with. None of these things are reliable predictors of job performance, but they have a large impact on the hiring decision.

Corporations like to think that there interview process is aimed at getting the best candidates possible, but this isn’t the whole truth. The incentive structure for interviewers isn’t set up to ensure this. While it is true that in the abstract, a corporation wants to hire the best employee, at the lowest price. In reality, the individual making the hiring decision just wants an outcome that doesn't end in him or her getting fired or judged negatively for making a bad hiring decision. Therefore, there is some value in them selecting a candidate who has gone to a high status university or worked at a high status company. This is because if things go terribly they can't be blamed for the poor hiring decision.

An interviewer’s ranking criteria is probably some kind of amalgamation of: who would be the best person to work with, who presents themselves the best and finally who they think can perform well in the role.

The predictors of job performance are fairly well known and have long been studied in the scientific literature. From a theoretical point of view, the research suggests that the central determining variables in job performance are GMA (general mental ability or intelligence), job experience and the personality trait of conscientiousness.

> "General mental ability or intelligence is consistently the best predictor of job performance. Presumably, this is because a new role requires you to learn new things and GMA directly affects you ability to learn and utilise new information effectively."

> "The major direct causal impact of mental ability has been found to be on the acquisition of job knowledge. That is, the major reason more intelligent people have higher job performance is that they acquire job knowledge more rapidly and acquire more of it; and it is this knowledge of how to perform the job that causes their job performance to be higher. Thus, mental ability has its most important effect on job performance indirectly, through job knowledge."

> "The major personality trait that has been studied in causal models of job performance is conscientiousness. This research has found that, controlling for mental ability, employees who are higher in conscientiousness develop higher levels of job knowledge, probably because highly conscientious individuals exert greater efforts and spend more time 'on task.' This job knowledge, in turn, causes higher levels of job performance."

Conscientiousness indicates someone who is hardworking, dutiful and organized, while emotional stability indicates someone’s ability to effectively deal with negative emotions and move forward after failure. Predicting these traits is extraordinarily helpful to managers who want employees to be able to take constructive criticism, learn from mistakes and improve with time.

> "Of the combinations of predictors examined, two stand out as being both practical to use for most hiring and as having high composite validity: the combination of a GMA test and an integrity test (composite validity of .65); and the combination of a GMA test and a structured interview. (composite validity of .63). Both of these combinations can be used with applicants with no previous experience on the job (entry level applicants), as well as with experienced applicants. Both combinations predict performance in job training programs quite well (.67 and .59, respectively), as well as performance on the job. And both combinations are less expensive to use than many other combinations. Hence, both are excellent choices. However, in particular cases there might be reasons why an employer might choose to use one of the other combinations with high, but slightly lower, validity. Some examples are combinations that include conscientiousness tests, work sample tests, job knowledge tests, and the behavioral consistency method."

Work sample tests are hands-on simulations of part or all of the job that must be performed by applicants. For example, a coding test in which the candidate is given a laptop and asked to do some task that is typical of day to day activities in the role they are interviewing for. Work sample tests can be used only with applicants who already know the job

⁴

Interviews today commonly contain leetcode or computer science type of questions. While these questions can have some correlation with coding ability and intelligence, they are rarely a good measure of role based competency. Another problem with these questions is that competency in them is largely just a matter of study and practice. Most people are good at algorithm interviews only because they've practiced them a lot. They've seen basically all the different kinds of questions that can get asked on an interview, and are able to use that mental database to answer any questions. In all likelihood, if they do well it is because they've seen that exact problem, or an extremely similar problem before. The breadth and absurdity of this can be seen in the fact that there is a whole industry, from books to websites to classes and online schools, that is focused on teaching people how to do well in these types of interview questions. These interviewing resources are entirely focused on helping people get better at something they would never need for a real job. Most programmers wouldn’t need to write code to reverse a tree or write a quicksort algorithm from scratch because they would just use a library. It is absurd that a smart experienced passionate developer that is well-spoken and works great with a team and customers will get a no hire decision because they can’t scrawl out code for quicksort. It is absurd that highly competent and senior developers need to restudy leetcode type questions when they want to start going for interviews,

One of the primary goals in an interview should be to test the candidate's ability to perform in something similar to the environment they'd be working in. The challenges of the interview should, therefore, be challenges that are likely to appear in their day-to-day work environment.Things like "refactoring code on a whiteboard, without the ability to insert text or copy-paste" are exceedingly challenging, but don't appear in real work. Neither do things like "remembering the API of a library without looking up documentation".

Leet code type of questions can be a valuable tool, but they shouldn't be used as an alternative to a targeted and focused evaluation of a candidates abilities. As developers get more senior in level, The areas in which you can go deep and have focused evaluations increases which means the reliance on the broader leetcode type of questions should be smaller.

⁵

Some common anti patterns or indicators that someone will be a low quality developer are:

- Poor communicator. I have no idea what they just said, or how they reached a conclusion. Or I ask a direct question and they evade it or talk endlessly without answering.
- Poor code quality. Bad choices, poorly organized, etc.
- Doesn’t explore the problem before jumping into a solution. I expect engineers to validate their assumptions and identify edge cases upfront.
- Broad knowledge gaps. This isn’t about arcane trivia or gotchas, but big areas that someone should have at least been curious about during their career. E.g. a senior candidate who has never thought about using key-value stores.
- Not self-motivated. Needs excessive hand-holding to move to the next step.
- Not detail-oriented. Misses obvious edge cases, didn’t understand the problem in the first place.
- Veers into the weeds. Makes up crazy requirements or assumptions.
- Solutions are overly complicated.
- Doesn’t interact with the interviewer. No back-and-forth of questions, doesn’t respond to feedback or hints.
- Condescending.
- Unnecessarily dogmatic.

> "One of the most consistent findings in the history of research on the employment interview is that structured interviews are much more reliable and valid than unstructured interviews. Twelve meta-analyses have been conducted on this topic, and they have consistently found strong evidence for the superiority of structured interviews compared to unstructured interviews"

> "Unstructured interviews have been criticized for their low reliability, low validity, and susceptibility to different biases, such as race, gender, and disability. Biases may occur when interviewers gather and evaluate nonjob-related information about applicants. Because interviewers conduct unstructured interviews in an idiosyncratic way and have discretion in what they ask and how they evaluate responses, the content and evaluation process in unstructured interviews may be more reflective of the interviewers’ implicit theories of the job requirements than the actual job requirements. Structured interviews have stronger psychometric properties because structure links the decision process to job-related factors and limits the influence of extraneous information, such as disability, gender, or race."

Structured interviews increase psychometric properties by increasing standardization and assisting the interviewer in determining what questions to ask or how to evaluate responses. Structure is an effective way in which the impact of different biasing factors on interview ratings. Structured interviews have specific characteristics in regards to their content and evaluation dimensions.

Content

- basing questions on a job analysis
- asking the same questions of each applicant
- limiting prompting, follow-up, and elaboration on questions
- using better types of questions
- using longer interviews or larger number of questions
- controlling ancillary information
- not allowing questions from applicant until after the interview
- Limiting rapport building.
- Interview transparency

Evaluation

- rating each answer or using multiple scales
- using anchored rating scales
- taking notes
- using multiple interviewers
- using the same interviewer(s) across all applicants
- not discussing applicants/answers between interviews
- providing interviewer training
- using statistical, rather than clinical, prediction
- Recording of interviews

The components utilized most frequently are job analysis, same questions, better types of questions, anchored rating scales, rating each question, and training

#### Limited rapport building

Rapport building occurs prior to an interview and includes “small talk” or casual conversation that is initiated by the interviewer in order to put applicants at ease. The most likely effect of limiting rapport building is enhanced validity via decreasing contamination. Social psychological research suggests that people form impressions very quickly. As such, interviewers may form early impressions based on the rapport building phase where nonjob-related information is exchanged and before any structured questions are asked.

#### Interview transparency

This is defined as the extent to which the interview dimensions assessed are made known to the applicants before or during the interview. When applicants are told what interview questions measure, they can better recall relevant past work experiences and use them in the answers.

Beyond intentional strategies organizations use to provide applicants with information prior to an interview, interview questions may become known to applicants through other means. For example, there are various websites that list common questions asked at specific companies (e.g., www.glassdoor.com, www.vault.com), and job applicants may post their interview questions online after their interviews. Interviews with high levels of structure may increase the likelihood of question leakage because there is a predetermined and relatively small set of questions that might become easily available to applicants without organizational “approval.”

#### Types of questions

Situational questions have emerged as the most popular types of structured interview questions (SQ). SQs are based on goal-setting theory and rely on the assumption that intentions predict future behavior. As such, SQs ask applicants to describe what they would do in hypothetical job-related situations. One of the core aspects of SQs is a dilemma, which requires an applicant to choose between two or more exclusive courses of action. Conversely, PBQs are based on the premise that past behavior predicts future behavior. As such, PBQs ask applicants to describe what they did in past job-related situations. In sum, the reviewed studies seem to suggest that when SQs and PBQs are carefully designed to assess the same characteristics, they tend to measure different constructs, with SQs primarily measuring job knowledge or cognitive ability and PBQs primarily measuring experience and perhaps some personality facets.

The reviewed research suggests that SQs have slightly lower criterion validity than PBQs, especially for high-complexity jobs. Yet, this finding does not necessarily mean that only PBQs should be used, as both SQs and PBQs have good validity for most jobs. Instead, researchers commonly recommend the use of both question types, in part because SQs and PBQs tend to measure different constructs and may complement each other to increase overall criterion-related validity and also because they allow some variety in question format.

#### Probing, Follow-up, Prompting, and Elaboration on Questions

When the initial response of the applicant to the interview question is incomplete or inadequate, the interviewer may ask further probing questions to help the applicant complete his or her answer.

Planned probing could be used to help applicants who might be shy or speak in succinct ways to clarify their answers and provide more detailed job-related information. Probing might also help applicants recall and identify the most relevant experiences they need to describe in order to best present their true job-related credentials. The use of unlimited probing may lead to low reliability, validity, and increased susceptibility to different biases because interviewers will have more discretion in what they ask and how they ask it.

The effects of probing in structured interviews are still unclear. The debate as to whether probing increases answer accuracy (and, therefore, more accurate ratings) or introduces contamination and bias has not been sufficiently settled. A better conceptual understanding of probing, including different types of probing (e.g., verifying, quantifying, testing, etc.) is needed.

Probing that enhances the difficulty of the question (e.g., “What would you do if this course of action does not work?”), verifying (e.g., “Who can verify your accomplishments?”), and quantifying (e.g., “You mentioned that you were successful in managing your team. How many members were in your team? What outcomes were achieved?”) is likely to reduce fake answers by making the question more difficult or increasing accountability.

There is not much research into the use of probing and until research demonstrates whether probing increases or decreases faking and validity, a practical recommendation is to only use planned neutral probes that will not cue the applicant to desired answers, to probe equally across all applicants, allow the same time limit for answers, and only probe if the answer is clearly deficient, or off track, or the applicant is shy.

#### Developing Anchored Rating Scales

Anchored rating scales (ARSs) have been developed to assist interviewers with applicant evaluation. ARSs can simplify the complex judgmental tasks by providing behavioral, descriptive, or evaluative examples to illustrate points on the rating scale. To evaluate responses, the interviewer matches the applicant’s responses with the written anchors for each question.

⁸

Employment interviews can be either structured or unstructured. Unstructured interviews have no fixed format or set of questions to be answered. In fact, the same interviewer often asks different applicants different questions. There is also no fixed procedure for scoring responses; in fact, responses to individual questions are usually not scored and only an overall evaluation (or rating) is given to each applicant, based on summary impressions and judgments. Structured interviews are exactly the opposite on all counts. In addition, the questions to be asked are usually determined by a careful analysis of the job in question. As a result, structured interviews are more costly to construct and use, but are also more valid and useful.

Structured interviews have many benefits over unstructured ones. For example,

- They’re more objective as each candidate is asked the same questions based on what is required for the role.
- They’re more predictive. Research shows that structured interviews are more effective at predicting job performance than unstructured ones. Especially when they are focused on the core competencies that are required for the role.
- They’re more legally compliant. Hiring that is unduly affected by bias can lead to legal issues. This is less of an issue for structured interviews because of the high levels of the consistency of interviews across applicants, the relatedness between the job and the questions asked and the extent to which the interview is designed to be objective.
