# Structured-constraints

We all operate under constraints. These constraints are the boundaries that determine who we will become. Too often we seek freedom or power so as to eliminate or reduce these constraints. This can be useful in terms of liberation, but what we should be seeking is structure in our constraints. Constraints limit us, control us, but they also stop us from becoming the worst version of ourselves. They can also be guides so that we can become the best.

> “We’re taught Lord Acton’s axiom: all power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. I believed that when I started these books, but I don’t believe it’s always true anymore. Power doesn’t always corrupt. Power can cleanse. What I believe is always true about power is that power always reveals. … When you have enough power to do what you always wanted to do, then you see what they guy always wanted to do. ― Roberto Caro

Power provides agency and opportunity. It, therefore, heightens pre-existing ethical tendencies as it allows that which would otherwise have been quashed by constraints, e.g. lack of money or power over others. It is for this reason that prosperity often leads to egotistical, callous or self-destructive behaviors. It removes the constraints that bind us to who we wish we were or are compelled to be. It also allows us to do that which is at the edge of our moral boundaries.

As a species, we are quick to underestimate our capacity for evil. Perhaps, this is because the majority of evil is formed over long periods of time. It is human nature to adapt and it is no different with we could be call the evil perpetrated by ordinary men. We adapt to it, see [Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101]([Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland](https://www.amazon.com/Ordinary-Men-Reserve-Battalion-Solution/dp/0060995068)), with every unscrupulous and immoral thing we do our moral boundaries get pushed further out. Our rationalisations become more easy to make.

Most of the time those that are given power are those that already seem powerful, sure and confident. The only way to gain confidence is through either ardourus experience and well earned competence or by faking it. That is, either gaining competence or feigning competence. Feigning competence is the path of the foolish, but not necessarily the stupid. It requires the ability to blame others when the lack of competence leads to consequences and this requires intelligence as does any successful long term deceit. It is a path for the foolish because it is only a fool that would hide their flaws or try to remove anyone that would point them out.

Those that seek power for righteous reasons are rarely left uncorrupted. Most often becoming no better than those they sought to replace. The road to gaining and maintaining power demands much. It is a conquest that is often only achieved through obsession. Obsessions seep into your soul and come to define who you are and what you believe. The obsession is never sated because the quest for power never ends. You gain power, adapt to it and the start obsessing once again about how to get more.

> Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you - Friedrich Nietzsche

Great men, those who are able to wield power without it corrupting them are men who have carefully cultivated constraints and are able to retain them even when they have the power to let them go.

> If you want to find out what a man is to the bottom, give him power. Any man can stand adversity — only a great man can stand prosperity. It is the glory of Abraham Lincoln that he never abused power only on the side of mercy. He was a perfectly honest man. When he had power, he used it in mercy ... Wealth could not purchase, power could not awe, this divine, this loving man. He knew no fear except the fear of doing wrong - Robert Ingersoll
