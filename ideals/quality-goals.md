Quality¹ goals 


---

¹ A common definition of good goals is that they should be SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound). This is true, but a slightly superfluous definition that is also missing some important aspects which are tied to how human motivation works. . The issues with this definition are that:
 -  attainable is redundant due to there also being realistic
 -  specific is redundant due to their also being measurable and time-anchored
 -  Goals should be challenging as this allows us to progress towards the ideal and get into states of flow
 -  Goals should be meaningful and connected to things you desire

Hundreds of books stress SMART goals: goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Anchored.30 Is this recommendation backed by good research? Not quite. 

It's also important to break up goals into lots of smaller subgoals which, by themselves, are easier to achieve and have more immediate deadlines. Typically, daily goals are frequent enough, but it can also help to set an immediate goal to break you through the "getting started" threshold. Your first goal can be "Write the email to the producer," and your next goal can be the daily goal. Once that first, 5-minute task has been completed, you'll probably already be on your way to the larger daily goal, even if it takes 30 minutes or 2 hours.31

Also: Are your goals measuring inputs or outputs? Is your goal to spend 30 minutes on X or is it to produce final product X? Try it different ways for different tasks, and see what works for you.

Because we are creatures of habit, it helps to get into a routine.32 For example: Exercise at the same time, every day.

 - progresses towards the ideal. 
 - is reachable Success spirals A series of "small wins" can give you the confidence you need to expect success.
  When you achieve one challenging goal after another, your obviously gain confidence in your ability to succeed. So: give yourself a series of meaningful, challenging but achievable goals, and then achieve them! Set yourself up for success by doing things you know you can succeed at, again and again, to keep your confidence high. Your brain will reward you with increased expectancy for success.

 See Steel (2010a), note 9 in chapter 7.
 Steel (2010a). The Procrastination Equation. New York: Harper.
  Steel recommends that for starters, "it is often best to have process or learning goals rather than product or outcome goals. That is, the goals are acquiring or refining new skills or steps (the process) rather than winning or getting the highest score (the product)."
For example, instead of “Make one new sale every day” (outcome goal) have “Make 20 sales calls a day” (process goal) be your goal. You have complete and direct control over how many sales calls you make. You do not necessarily have complete and direct control over “Make one new sale every day”. However, your process goal should be aligned with your outcome. So if you want to make a new sale every day and you average one close per 20 calls then your process goal of 20 calls per day should get you to your outcome goal. 

 > The inherent problem with goal setting is related to how the brain works. Recent neuroscience research shows the brain works in a protective way, resistant to change. Therefore, any goals that require substantial behavioural change or thinking-pattern change will automatically be resisted. The brain is wired to seek rewards and avoid pain or discomfort, including fear. When fear of failure creeps into the mind of the goal setter it commences a de-motivator with a desire to return to known, comfortable behaviour and thought patterns. - [Ray Williams](https://business.financialpost.com/executive/careers/why-goal-setting-doesnt-work) 

 > Goal setting sets up an either-or polarity of success. The only true measure can either be 100% attainment or perfection, or 99% and less, which is failure. We can then excessively focus on the missing or incomplete part of our efforts, ignoring the successful parts. Fourthly, goal setting doesn't take into account random forces of chance. You can't control all the environmental variables to guarantee 100% success - [Ray Williams](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201104/why-goal-setting-doesnt-work)

  Increase the size of a task's reward (including both the pleasantness of doing the task and the value of its after-effects), and your motivation goes up. Increase the perceived odds of getting the reward, and your motivation also goes up.

My own behavior baffles me. I find myself doing what I hate, and not doing what I really want to do!

- Saint Paul (Romans 7:15)

In the renowned 1993 study of young violinists, performance researcher Anders Ericsson found that the best ones all practiced the same way: in the morning, in three increments of no more than 90 minutes each, with a break between each one. Ericcson found the same pattern among other musicians, athletes, chess players and writers.


 You need a goal, but we don't want to let your distance from the goal crush you. Break the goal down into parts, so that you can move toward the goal and you have a reasonably high probability of success.


The comparison between the present and the ideal is the inducer of improvement, but is also a judgement. To improve you must first notice a flaw. if there aren't any flaws and sometimes seeing our flaws can be hard. 

Ideals require goals  benefits of having an ideal without the crushing blow of the judge that makes you feel insufficient, as well as the power behind incremental self-improvement.
