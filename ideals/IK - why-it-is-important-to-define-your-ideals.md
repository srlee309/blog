# Why it is important to define your ideals

Improvement always starts with a comparison to something more idealistic. That is, it is always directed towards an ideal. The ideal determines your aim in the improvement process. It determines how you are going to improve and in what areas you are going to try and improve. Therefore, finding the right ideal and making it concrete enough to be useful is very important if you want to improve in ways that you will find valuable.

> sometimes the problem is to discover what the problem is - Gordon Clegg, 1969, The design of design

When improving, there must always be prestructures and ideas about where we want to head. That is, there must be some kind of ideal. If we do not consider the ideal to which we are aspiring, then we will settle for low quality surrogates, defaults which we have only briefly or not even been considered. These ideals will be low quality. They will often vacillate, be short term and have low fidelity.

> The vast field of possibility can only be searched if you have some idea in advance of what you are looking for. Without prestructures of some kind, you cannot know where to look or whether you have found what you are looking for. - Bill Hillier and Alan Penn, 1995, "Can there be a domain-independent theory of design?"

An ideal is not enough by itself. Ideals are navigational aids, not end points. An ideal is something to which we always fall short. It is something to aspire to and strive towards, but conceptualised well it is something that is unrealisable. An ideal is an imagined excellence. It is something flawless. This is why comparing it to the present allows us to spot flaws (areas to improve) in the present.

Since ideals are unrealisable, if they are to be useful, they must be tempered with goals. When ideals are fixated upon, they can be soul crushing as they are things that can never be reached. Compared to the ideal the present is always insufficient. Therefore, progression towards an ideal and the evaluation of that progression requires moving towards something realisable (goals). Ideals are broader and more general than goals are. For example, an ideal of athletic excellence is more comprehensive and general in nature than the healthy person’s ordinary goal of going jogging once a week.

## The importance of defining your ideals increases when you work in teams

Working in teams increases the need to define your ideals. This is because teams are made up of individuals who work on different tasks at different levels of abstraction. Over time, there is a natural divergence between the people inside a team in their conceptions of the ideal and where they want the team to head. This is problematic because teams are most productive when the individuals within them work together to achieve common goals. Therefore, reaching convergence on and defining the ideals to which a team is heading is often a valuable task as it allows teams to gain and maintain cohesion.

In my opinion, five of the most useful ideals for teams are:

- Synergy – synergy is a concept that could be summarized by saying that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
- Corrigibility – corrigibility is about the ability to be corrected, coached, reformed or improved. Corrigibility is an essential requirement when dealing with uncertainty.
- Quality – quality is the key to being able to consistently deliver high levels of value in the long term.
- Focus through automation/delegation – the domains that we now operate are too complicated and complex for us to be able to excel in all of them. Resources are also limited, therefore, it is important at the individual and team level to be focused on particular areas where you can deliver the most value.
