You cannot change the past, but you can change how you percieve it, what you draw out of it.
## Meaning

“A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the "why" for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any "how".”
― Victor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning

It also helps to make sure tasks are connected to something you care about for its own sake,22 at least through a chain: you read the book so you can pass the test so you can get the grade so you can get the job you want and have a fulfilling career. Breaking the chain leaves a task feeling meaningless.

Every time we act, we amplify the underlying idea or tendency.

If we wish to conquer undesirable emotional tendencies in ourselves, we must assiduously, and in the first instance cold-bloodedly, go through the outward motions of those contrary dispositions we prefer to cultivate. William James

Pennebaker’s research and the importance of self-disclosing traumatic events to other people or a diary. Newer research on trauma writing suggests that it is not so much telling someone about the event, as it is constructing a narrative to explain what happened. That is, the key factor involved is making-sense-of.

Adaption
hedonic adaptation—“the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes.”
At first, we react strongly to changes in circumstances, but, over time, their emotional impacts lose their power. We take good things for granted. We overcome obstacles. In both cases, we may freak out in the beginning, but then move on as if it were no big deal. In other words, we adapt.

To comprehend and cope with our environments we develop models of them. These models drive all behaviour ranging from decisions down to habilitual  or instinctive if-then behaviours. This is because the if condition is triggered by the recognition of something in the model.

We don't see the world as it is we see the world as we expect it to be and use our observations to better align our models.

Passion

Of course, the most powerful way to increase the value of a task is to focus on doing what you love wherever possible. It doesn't take much extra motivation for me to research meta-ethics or write summaries of scientific self-help: that is what I love to do. Some people who love playing video games have made careers out of it. To figure out which career might be full of tasks that you love to do, taking a RIASEC personality test might help. In the USA, O\*NET can help you find jobs that are in-demand and fit your personality.

As Paul Graham points out, a lot of the cool things that have been accomplished in the past weren’t done through self-discipline:

> One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea that doing great things requires a lot of discipline. Most subjects are taught in such a boring way that it's only by discipline that you can flog yourself through them. ... I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline. You probably need about the amount you need to go running. I'm often reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it. And if I don't run for several days, I feel ill. It's the same with people who do great things. They know they'll feel bad if they don't work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary. Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to write Great Literature? Of course not. He was having fun. That's why he's so good. - [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html)

Paul Graham on "How to do what you love":
It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they did so much that there was nothing they'd rather do. There didn't seem to be any sort of work I liked that much. If I had a choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b) be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was there any sort of work I'd prefer? Honestly, no.
But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment, float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious food, than work on hard problems. The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time. It doesn't mean, do what will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month.
Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something.
As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive pleasure. You have to like what you do enough that the concept of "spare time" seems mistaken. Which is not to say you have to spend all your time working. You can only work so much before you get tired and start to screw up. Then you want to do something else—even something mindless. But you don't regard this time as the prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn it.
I put the lower bound there for practical reasons. If your work is not your favorite thing to do, you'll have terrible problems with procrastination. You'll have to force yourself to work, and when you resort to that the results are distinctly inferior.
Another quote from Paul Graham:
The way to work for long periods on something is to be interested in it. Few to no people have the discipline to make themselves work on something that bores them for many hours straight without paging it out. Probably none of the people whose work I admire do. Their trick is to work on stuff they like
The latter is the type of rationalization that Paul talked about in his recent essay Self-Indulgence, where the wost time-wasters are those that don't feel like time-wasters:
The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work. When you spend time having fun, you know you're being self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly. If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd feel like something was terribly wrong. Just thinking about it makes me wince. I'd start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.
And yet I've definitely had days when I might as well have sat in front of a TV all day—days at the end of which, if I asked myself what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically, nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad as I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV. If I spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was descending into perdition. But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work.

“Remember: Oppression thrives off isolation. Connection is the only thing that can save you. Remember: Oppression thrives on superficiality. Honesty about your struggles is the key to your liberation. Remember: Your story can help save someone’s life. Your silence contributes to someone else’s struggle. Speak so we can all be free. Love so we all can be liberated. The moment is now. We need you.”-Yolo Akili

Passion and problem solving, and so much more, are apart of the human drive and desire for fulfillment. Earlier, they made an interesting insight into how working toward mastery of some kind, heightens the experience of the thing itself. I know in college I loved my 'Gen-Eds',  but as I finally declared my majors and focused on them, their beauty unfolded, and as I began to take command, all the passion and relationships between myself and the the craft and the world itself, revealed themselves. More succinctly (echoing what they said), I liked these majors more as I got better at them. Anyway, that was a long winded way of saying: truth and world view, are the majors, and introspection and creative/expressive pursuits can be the 'getting better at them.'
You don't find passion. You create it. Exploring a domain makes you see it differently. 
Gaining mastery is a fundamental part of creating passion. Because this unlocks flow. Doing well at something is enjoyable.

Agency is driven by friction of both ideals (I didn't know that was possible or learned helplessness I could never do that) and friction of action being able to turn ideas into implementation and get them working in reality.

Intelligence is a large aspect of agency which is why a super intelligent AI is uncontrollable. It would be able to do things that you can't fathom or think are impossible, e.g. put you into a hypnotic trance and you make you do what it wants.

Responsibilities and duties are the most significant reducers of agency. Therefore, it is important to choose them well. Responsibilities, duties and passions are the keystones of vitality. They imbue life with meaning. They put in front of you things worth pursuing.

Discipline, exploration and safe failures are the antecedents of increased agency because they lead to master or less friction.
